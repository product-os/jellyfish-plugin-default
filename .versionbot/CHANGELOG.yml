      hash: f5b4b54aa2e7a968e66c3301969e08d2909046d9
      body: |
        Occasionally, there isn't an account name available and we only have the
        machine name. To improve data capture this change removes the
        requirements for accounts to have names and also looks for the account
        name in more locations when syncing balena webhooks.

        Fixes https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/issues/6545

      hash: eb7dd914a37a154737216691e2174b79e4e8e4f3
      body: >
        Note - although the project contract type already existed, there are no
        active projects in production and no view of projects. So it is fairly
        safe to modfy the schema as per this commit.

        Although this is technically a breaking change, the status options will
        just be manually migrated as there are only 3 affected improvement
        contracts in production.

        this package is also encouraged/forced to use compatible versions of
        those peer dependencies.

    - subject: Specify enum names for improvement status values
      hash: cddde9c48c18557c7fb227fe9d61d29e9a53a71f
      body: >
        product-improvement is the only use of `asPipelineItem` that requires
        enumNames to be overwritten.


        Note - as a related fix we should update jellyfish-ui-component's
        getViewSlices helper method to make use of the `enumNames` (if defined)
        to return the appropriate value name (label) as well. That way we can
        make use of it when displaying the Status dropdown component in the View
        header.
