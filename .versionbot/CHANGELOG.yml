    - subject: Decay pattern weight over time
      hash: ef2fde2c45364b60bddce01002a45373a6eaec3e
      body: |
        This change uses the same decay algorithm as Hackernews:
        ```
        Score = (P) / (T+2)^G

        where,
        P = points of an item (number of times contract is linked to)
        T = time since creation (in hours)
        G = Gravity, defaults to 1.8 in news.arc
        ```

        This is re-calculated whenever the pattern is updated, essentially
        a "poor mans cron". Once scheduled actions are implemented, we should be
        able to recalculate the weight at explicit intervals.

    - subject: Ensure contact triggered action always fires on a user update
      hash: b64f3802fd3c38ed91f57232298e64b6c261485c
      body: |
        This fixes a bug where only the initial user creation would cause
        a contact to be updated and subsequent updates to the user were
        ignored. This regression bug was caused by the change to
        triggered-action evaluation where the trigger only matches if the
        filtered fields have changed.
        See https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish-worker/pull/1037

        This is a simple way to represent how many contracts a pattern is linked
        to. Long term I'd like to introduce a time element here, so that the
        weight decays over time.

      hash: 3d82e4c02ac8c543ff1c01a1f658e18d81717435
      body: >
        The jellyfish threads view is distinctly a product-os specific contract

        as it displays support threads *about* product-os.

        It was moved into the product-os plugin as part of this PR
        https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish-plugin-product-os/pull/472

        Long term, there is still an open question about wether or not

        product-os features are part of the core Jellyfish offering, or just

        a use case, but I will defer that discussion to a later time.

      hash: f5b4b54aa2e7a968e66c3301969e08d2909046d9
      body: |
        Occasionally, there isn't an account name available and we only have the
        machine name. To improve data capture this change removes the
        requirements for accounts to have names and also looks for the account
        name in more locations when syncing balena webhooks.

        Fixes https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/issues/6545

      hash: eb7dd914a37a154737216691e2174b79e4e8e4f3
      body: >
        Note - although the project contract type already existed, there are no
        active projects in production and no view of projects. So it is fairly
        safe to modfy the schema as per this commit.

        Although this is technically a breaking change, the status options will
        just be manually migrated as there are only 3 affected improvement
        contracts in production.

        As we test against particular versions of these JF packages, it makes

        this package is also encouraged/forced to use compatible versions of
        those peer dependencies.

    - subject: Specify enum names for improvement status values
      hash: cddde9c48c18557c7fb227fe9d61d29e9a53a71f
      body: >
        product-improvement is the only use of `asPipelineItem` that requires
        enumNames to be overwritten.


        Note - as a related fix we should update jellyfish-ui-component's
        getViewSlices helper method to make use of the `enumNames` (if defined)
        to return the appropriate value name (label) as well. That way we can
        make use of it when displaying the Status dropdown component in the View
        header.
